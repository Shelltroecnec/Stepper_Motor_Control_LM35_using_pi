# Stepper_Motor_Control_LM35_using_pi
In this Project the Stepper Motor speed and Direction is Controlled using LM35 and IR sensor
**NOTE: This is a Prototype Project, if find any issues in workinf plz do let me known.

*Hardware used in this Project:
>Arduino uno

>Stepper Motor (Nemma-14)

>LM35 (Temperature Sensor)

>Bluetooth Module (HC_05)

>Stepper Motor Driver (IC A4988)

*Software used in this Project :
>Arduino IDE (For Coding and Uploading Code to Micro-Controller)

*Project Description : In this Project the Stepper Motor is Rotating at a constant 1/4 Steps per Revolution. As the Temperature around is increased in increased more than 28*C it will start to rotate at full step per Revolution. And if the Motion is Detected with the use of IR(Infrared Sensor) it start to rotate at 1/2 the steps per Revolution Cycles.
